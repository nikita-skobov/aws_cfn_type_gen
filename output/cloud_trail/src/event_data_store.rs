To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3        bucket, use the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket ARN as        the matching value.        The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. Replace the text between        less than and greater than symbols (<>) with resource-specific information.                                                            arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/                                            arn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/                             When resources.type equals AWS::DynamoDB::Table, and the operator is        set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the        following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:dynamodb:<region>:<account_ID>:table/<table_name>                             When resources.type equals AWS::Lambda::Function, and the operator is        set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the        following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:lambda:<region>:<account_ID>:function:<function_name>                             When resources.type equals AWS::CloudTrail::Channel, and the operator is        set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the        following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:cloudtrail:<region>:<account_ID>:channel/<channel_UUID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool, and the operator is        set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the        following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:cognito-identity:<region>:<account_ID>:identitypool/<identity_pool_ID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::DynamoDB::Stream, and        the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be        in the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:dynamodb:<region>:<account_ID>:table/<table_name>/stream/<date_time>                             When resources.type equals AWS::EC2::Snapshot, and the        operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in        the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:ec2:<region>::snapshot/<snapshot_ID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::FinSpace::Environment,        and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN        must be in the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:finspace:<region>:<account_ID>:environment/<environment_ID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::Glue::Table, and the        operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in        the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:glue:<region>:<account_ID>:table/<database_name>/<table_name>                             When resources.type equals AWS::GuardDuty::Detector, and the        operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in        the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:guardduty:<region>:<account_ID>:detector/<detector_ID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::KendraRanking::ExecutionPlan, and the        operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in        the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:kendra-ranking:<region>:<account_ID>:rescore-execution-plan/<rescore_execution_plan_ID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node,        and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN        must be in the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:managedblockchain:<region>:<account_ID>:nodes/<node_ID>                             When resources.type equals AWS::SageMaker::ExperimentTrialComponent, and the operator is set to        Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:sagemaker:<region>:<account_ID>:experiment-trial-component/<experiment_trial_component_name>                             When resources.type equals AWS::SageMaker::FeatureGroup, and the operator is set to        Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in the following format:                                                  arn:<partition>:sagemaker:<region>:<account_ID>:feature-group/<feature_group_name>                             When resources.type equals AWS::S3::AccessPoint, and the        operator is set to Equals or NotEquals, the ARN must be in        one of the following formats.
