A subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private)     that you can designate for your clusters running in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. When you create a cluster in an Amazon VPC,     you must specify a subnet group. MemoryDB uses that subnet group to choose a     subnet and IP addresses within that subnet to associate with your nodes. For more     information, see Subnets and subnet     groups.
