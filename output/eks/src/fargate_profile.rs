/// Creates an AWS Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster. You       must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run       pods on Fargate.
///
/// The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run       on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate       profile. This declaration is done through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each profile can have       up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for       every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that       match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod       matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run       on Fargate.
///
/// When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution       role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the       cluster's Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization so that the         kubelet that is running on the Fargate infrastructure       can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster       as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the         Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR       image repositories. For more information, see Pod         Execution Role in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
///
/// Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated       profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated       profile has finished creating.
///
/// If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the DELETING       status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before       you can create any other profiles in that cluster.
