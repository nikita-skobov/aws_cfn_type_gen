/// AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS to edge devices so they can act locally on the data they generate, while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. With AWS IoT Greengrass, connected devices can run AWS Lambda functions, execute predictions based on machine learning models, keep device data in sync, and communicate with other devices securely â€“ even when not connected to the internet.  For more information, see the AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1 Developer Guide.
///
/// The     AWS::Greengrass::Group resource represents a group in AWS IoT Greengrass.   In the AWS IoT Greengrass API, groups are used to organize your group versions.
///
/// Groups can reference multiple group versions. All group versions      must be associated with a group. A group version references a     device definition version, subscription definition version, and other version types     that contain the components you want to deploy to a Greengrass core device.
///
/// To deploy a group version, the group version must reference a core definition version that      contains one core. Other version types are optionally included, depending on your business need.
///
/// Deploying a Group Version
///
/// After you create the group version in your AWS CloudFormation template, you can deploy it using the  		 aws greengrass create-deployment command in the AWS CLI or 		 from the Greengrass node in the AWS IoT console. To deploy a group version, you must have a Greengrass service role associated with 		    your AWS account. For more information, see AWS CloudFormation Support for AWS IoT Greengrass 		 in the AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1 Developer Guide.
