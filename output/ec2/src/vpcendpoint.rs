///
/// An interface endpoint establishes connections between the subnets in your VPC and an     AWS service, your own service, or a service hosted by another AWS account.     You can specify the subnets in which to create the endpoint and the security groups to      associate with the endpoint network interface.

/// A gateway endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined      for Amazon S3 or Amazon DynamoDB. You can specify an endpoint policy for the endpoint,      which controls access to the service from your VPC. You can also specify the VPC route tables      that use the endpoint. For information about connectivity to Amazon S3, see Why canâ€™t I connect to an S3 bucket using a gateway VPC endpoint?
